Hello Holmtowne Repository

This is the start of a bright future in coding and web-development.  I have been wanting/meaning to begin this process for a long time.  I'm not sure why I've waited so long, other than life, and work, getting involved.  Although, I refuse to wait any longer, so now begins the journey that will lead down another new path.  Maybe not the narrow path, but a new and path for me nonetheless, and one that may prove to be brightly lit.
